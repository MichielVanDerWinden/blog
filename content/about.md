## Michiel
Avid computer enthusiast; enjoys programming, automating, containerizing and sometimes a bit of gaming. Started out as a Java developer, turned Integration Consultant and eventually became an AWS Consultant.

Ever since coming into contact with my first computer I've been obsessed with knowing all about it. Started out tinkering with hardware and trying to make the best gaming computers, but eventually ran into things I wanted to automate. This triggered my search for knowledge about the internals of software, servers and eventually the cloud.

## My work
Over the last few years I've worked as an AWS Cloud Consultant. This means writing scripts, infrastructure as code (CDK, Terraform), CI/CD pipelines and more. Even though I love programming and scripting, I found that I'm enjoying the architectural parts (discussions with clients and colleagues, creating diagrams of architectural patterns and designs) even more. This role means combining the two, and getting the most out of the things I enjoy doing daily.

## This blog
I've tried starting a blog a few times now. Every time I think of a few interesting things to write about, but most of the time those turned out to be less interesting than I thought. So, this time I planned ahead - I made a list of things I wanted to write about (mostly things I encountered during my work) and chose a proper blog tool instead of trying to write one myself (which, to be honest, is loads of fun!)
